# ios-conv

June 9, 2023

ios-conv is one of many steps in a process I developed to extract notes from an iPhone backup and turn them into a series of discrete plain text files, which I could then feed into [msgen] to create one file I could turn into a published work.

# Usage
Here's the process I developed. It's convuluted...:
1. Download [iTunes Backup Explorer](https://github.com/MaxiHuHe04/iTunes-Backup-Explorer).
2. Extract the `NoteStore.sqlite` file. I was able to find it under Applications and then under `AppDomainGroup-group.com.apple.notes`
3. Download [Apple Cloud Notes Parser](https://github.com/threeplanetssoftware/apple_cloud_notes_parser).
4. Run the ripper program, providing your extracted NoteStore file in the process. See the notes parser README for more information on how to do this.
5. Find the all_notes JSON file in the notes parser program's output directory. Place this in the same directory you saved ios-conv.py into. Rename the JSON file to `inotes.json` and run ios-conv. Doing so will create one text file for every note contained in the NoteStore in the same directory as ios-conv. 
6. Download [Advanced Renamer](https://www.advancedrenamer.com/).
7. Add the method present in this repo `iphone-processing.aren`, add the files generated by ios-conv, and rename them. 
   This step is necessary because msgen will read the file modification timestamp and use that when putting its notes into chronological order. Feel free to accomplish this any other way.
8. Create a directory called notes/ and place ios-conv's generated files there
9. Run msgen (in the original working directory)... and you're done!
